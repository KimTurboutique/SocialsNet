# SocialsNet

```This project was built for a social network web application. An API was built to where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This project is still in it's development stage and will not be deployed, I will display the routes in Insomnia to demonstrate the API's functionality.```
